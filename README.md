# Firefox vertical tabs

## Setting it up

0. Install the [Sidebery extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/).
1. In Sidebery settings:
    1. Set the title preface must as "[S] " (without quotes).
        This is used by CSS rules below to identify when Sidebery is active.
    2. Set 'Tabs tree structure' to false -- this stylesheet doesn't adapt to
        multiple tab levels, but feel free to tweak it!
    3. Copy and paste the "SIDEBERY STYLES" section below in
        Sidebery's Styles Editor -> Sidebar.
    4. Optionally sync Sidebery settings to Firefox account to get other customizations.
2. Go to `about:support` -> copy 'user folder' location, setting it as the variable `$FF_USER_DIR`.
3. Move CSS files to FF user location:
    + `mv userChrome.css $FF_USER_DIR/userChrome.css`
    + `mv userContent.css $FF_USER_DIR/userContent.css`
4. Go to about:config -> `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to TRUE.
5. Restart Firefox ( ab`out:restartrequired` to reopen your current tabs ).
